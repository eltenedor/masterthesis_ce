        Optimization, Interfaces, Compiler Erros not helpful, Preallocation vs. Mallocs

    \subsection{Grid Generation and Conversion}
    Generation of block structured grids, neighbouring relations are represented by a special type of boundary conditions
    \subsection{Preprocessing}
    Matching algorithm - the idea behind clipper. Opencascade. Efficient calculation of values for discretization.
    \subsection{CAFFA3D}

      \subsubsection{MPI Programming Model}
