      Keep in mind not to copy the manual but
      \subsubsection{About PETSc}
        Bell Prize, MPI Programming

      \subsubsection{Profiling}
        Petsc Log 
      \subsubsection{Common Errors}
        Optimization, Interfaces, Compiler Erros not helpful, Preallocation vs. Mallocs

    \subsection{Grid Generation and Conversion}
    Generation of block structured grids, neighbouring relations are represented by a special type of boundary conditions
    \subsection{Preprocessing}
    Matching algorithm - the idea behind clipper and the used projection technique; alt.: Opencascade. Efficient calculation of values for discretization.
    \subsection{CAFFA3D}

      \subsubsection{MPI Programming Model}
        Basic idea of distributed memory programming model, emphasize the differences to shared memory model
      \subsubsection{Indexing of Variables and Treatment of Boundary Values}
      Describe MatZeroValues and how it is used to simplify the code. Compliance of PETSc zero based indexing and CAFFA indexing which considers boundary values. Problems with boundary entries
      \subsubsection{Field Interlacing}
      Realization through special arrangement of variables and the use of index sets (subvector objects) and/or preprocessor directives. Advantages (there was a paper I cited in my thesis)
      \subsubsection{Domain Decomposition, Ghosting and Parallel Matrix Assembly}

        Ghost values are stored in local representations of the global vector (state the mapping for those entries). Matrix coefficients are calculated on one processor and sent to the neighbour. Preallocation as crucial aspect for program performance. Present a simple method for balancing the matrix related load by letting PETSc take care of matrix distribution.
