abstract="Pressure-based finite-volume techniques have emerged as the methods of choice for a wide variety of industrial applications involving incompressible fluid flow. In this paper, we trace the evolution of this class of solution techniques. We review the basics of the finite-volume method, and trace its extension to unstructured meshes through the use of cell-based and control-volume finite-element schemes. A critical component of the solution of incompressible flows is the issue of pressure-velocity storage and coupling. The development of staggered-mesh schemes and segregated solution techniques such as the SIMPLE  algorithm are reviewed. Co-located storage schemes, which seek to replace staggered-mesh approaches, are presented. Coupled multigrid schemes, which promise to replace segregated-solution approaches, are discussed. Extensions of pressure-based techniques to compressible flows are presented. Finally, the shortcomings of existing techniques and directions for future research are discussed.",

, abstract = { Purpose – To provide an improved version of SIMPLER algorithm which can enhance the convergence rate of the iterative solution procedure in the field of computational fluid dynamics analysis.Design/methodology/approach – The improved version of SIMPLER algorithm is developed by modifying the coefficients of the velocity correction equation and implementing the correction of pressure within an iteration cycle.Findings – The CSIMPLER algorithm (the improved version) can enhance the convergence rate for almost all cases tested, especially for the low under‐relaxation factor situations. The pressure correction term even can be overrelaxed to further enhance the convergence rate.Research limitations/implications – The CSIMPLER algorithm can enhance the rate of convergence to different degree for different problems. It can only be adopted to solve the incompressible fluid flow and heat transfer.Practical implications – CSIMPLER is a simple and effectual method to enhance the convergence rate of the iterative process for the computational fluid dynamics analysis. The existing code of SIMPLER can be easily changed to CSIMPLER.Originality/value – The paper developed an improved version of SIMPLER algorithm with some minor changes in the existing SIMPLER code. }
