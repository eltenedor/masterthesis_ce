  \section{Finite Volume Method for Incompressible Flows -- Segregated Approach}

  The purpose of this section is to present the discretization applied to the set of equations (\ref{eq:setofeq}). The applied discretization techniques depend on the different terms of each equation, thus at first every equation will be discretized individually. The finite volume method relies on the discretization of integral equations, which will be derived at the beginning of each subsection that relies on them. Since the system of partial differential equations to be solved always exhibits coupling at least between the dependent variables pressure and velocity a first solution algorithm, namely the \textit{SIMPLE} algorithm addressed to resolve the pressure velocity coupling is introduced. The efficient coupling of the Navier-Stokes equations to the temperature equation is one part of the present thesis and will be addressed in a separate subsection. Furthermore every problem modelled by partial differential equations needs to provide valid boundary conditions. The discretization of those boundary conditions, that are relevant for the present thesis will be presented in their own subsection.

    \subsection{Discretization of the Mass Balance}

    Integration of equation (\ref{eq:contidiff}) over the integration domain of a single control volume \(P\) yields after the application of Gauss' integration theorem and the additivity of the Riemann integral
    \begin{displaymath}
      \iint\limits_S  u_i n_i \mathrm{d}S = \sum_{f \in \{w,s,b,t,n,e\}} \iint\limits_{S_f}  u_i n_{i} \mathrm{d}S = 0
    \end{displaymath}
    In the present work the mass balance is discretized using the midpoint rule for the surface integrals and linear interpolation of the velocity to to center of mass of the surface. This leads to the following form of the mass balance: 
    \begin{align*}
      \sum_{f \in \{w,s,b,t,n,e\}} u_{i_f} n_{f_i} S_f 
      &= u_{i_w} n_{w_i} S_w + u_{i_e} n_{e_i} S_e 
       + u_{i_s} n_{s_i} S_s + u_{i_n} n_{n_i} S_n 
       + u_{i_b} n_{b_i} S_b + u_{i_t} n_{t_i} S_t  \\
      &= ( \gamma_w u_{i_W} + (1 - \gamma_w ) u_{i_P} ) n_{w_i} S_w + ( \gamma_s u_{i_S} + (1 - \gamma_s ) u_{i_P} ) n_{s_i} S_s \\
      &\quad + ( \gamma_b u_{i_B} + (1 - \gamma_b ) u_{i_P} ) n_{b_i} S_b + ( \gamma_t u_{i_T} + (1 - \gamma_t ) u_{i_P} ) n_{t_i} S_t \\
      &\quad + ( \gamma_n u_{i_N} + (1 - \gamma_n ) u_{i_P} ) n_{n_i} S_n + ( \gamma_e u_{i_E} + (1 - \gamma_e ) u_{i_P} ) n_{e_i} S_e \\
      & =  0,
    \end{align*}
    where \( \gamma_f \) for \( f \in \{w,e,s,n,b,t\} \) is the geometrical interpolation factor.

    \subsection{Discretization of the Momentum Balance}

      The stationary momentum balance integrated over a single control volume \(P\) reads as
      \begin{displaymath}
        \underbrace{\iint\limits_S (\rho u_i u_j)n_j \mathrm{d}S}_{\text{convection term}}
        - \underbrace{\iint\limits_S \left(\mu \left( \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} + \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}\right)\right)n_j \mathrm{d}S}_{\text{diffusion term}}
        = - \overbrace{\iiint_V \frac{\partial p}{\partial x_i} \mathrm{d}V}^{\text{sourceterm pressure}}
        - \overbrace{\iiint_V \rho \beta \left(T - T_0\right) \mathrm{d}V}^{\text{sourceterm temperature}}
      \end{displaymath}
      where the different terms to be addressed individually in the following sections are indicated. Note that the form of this equation has been modified by using Gauss' integration theorem The terms residing on the left will be treated in an implicit manner whereas the terms on the right will be treated explicitly. 

      \subsubsection{Calculation of Mass Flux -- Rhie-Chow Interpolation}

      \subsubsection{Linearization and Discretization of the Convective Term}

      The convective term \(\rho u_i u_j\) of the Navier-Stokes equations is the reason for the non-linearity of the equations. In order to deduce a set of linear algebraic equations from the Navier-Stokes equations this term has to be linearized. As introduced in section (REFERENCE), the non linearity will be dealt with by means of an iterative process, the Picard iteration. The part dependent of the non dominant dependent variable therefore will be approximated by its value from the previous iteration as \( \rho u_i^{(n)} u_j^{(n)} \approx \rho u_i^{(n)} u_j^{(n-1)} \). Using the additivity of the Riemann integral the first step is to decompose the surface integral into individual contributions from each boundary face of the control volume \(P\)
      \begin{displaymath}
      \iint\limits_S (\rho u_i u_j)n_j \mathrm{d}S
      = \sum_{f \in \{w,s,b,t,n,e\}} \iint\limits_{S_f}\rho u_{i} u_{j} n_{j} \mathrm{d}S
%     \approx \sum_{f \in \{w,s,b,t,n,e\}} \iint\limits_{S_f} \rho u_{i}^{(n)} u_{j}^{(n-1)} n_{j} \mathrm{d}S,
      = \sum_{f \in \{w,s,b,t,n,e\}} F_{i,f}^{c}
      \end{displaymath}
      where \(F_{i,f}^c := \iint\limits_{S_f} \rho u_{i}^{(n)} u_{j}^{(n-1)} n_{j} \mathrm{d}S \) is the convective flux of the velocity \(u_i\) through the face \(S_f\). 
      
      To improve diagonal dominance of the resulting linear system while maintaining the smaller discretization error of a higher order discretization, a blended discretization scheme is applied using a deferred correction. Since due to the non-linearity of the equations to be solved an iterative solution process is needed by all means, the overall convergence doesn't degrade noticeably when using a deferred correction. Blending and deferred correction result in a decomposition of the convective flux into a lower order approximation that is treated implicitly and the explicit difference between the higher and lower order approximation for the same convective flux. Since for coarse grid resolutions the use of higher order approximations may lead to oscillations of the solution which may degrade or even impede convergence the schemes can be blended by a control factor \( \eta \in [0,1]\). For simplicity all further derivations are presented for the boundary face \(S_e\). This decomposition then leads to
      \begin{displaymath}
        F_{i,e}^c \approx  \underbrace{F_{i,e}^{c,l}}_{\text{implicit}} + \eta \bigl[\underbrace{ F_{i,e}^{c,h} - F_{i,e}^{c,l} }_{\text{explicit}}\bigr]^{(n-1)}.
      \end{displaymath}
      Note that the convective fluxes carrying a \(l\) or \(h\) as exponent, already have been linearized and discretized. The discretization applied to the convective flux in the present work is using the midpoint integration rule and blends the upwind interpolation scheme with the linear interpolation scheme. Applied to above decomposition one can derive the following approximations
      \begin{align*}
        F_{i,e}^{c,l} &= u_{i,E} \min(\dot{m}_e ,0) + u_{i,P} \max(0,\dot{m}_e) \\
        F_{i,e}^{c,h} &= u_{i,E} \gamma_e + u_{i,P} (1 - \gamma_e),
      \end{align*}
      where the variable values have to be taken from the previous iteration step \((n-1)\) as necessary and the mass flux \(\dot{m}_e\) has been used as result of the linearization process. The results can now be summarized by presenting the convective contribution to the matrix coefficients \(a_{E,u_i}\) and \(a_{P,u_i}\) and the right hand side \(b_{P,u_i}\) which are calculated as
      \begin{align}
        a_{E,u_i}^c &= \min(\dot{m}_e ,0), \quad a_{P,u_i}^c = \max(0,\dot{m}_e) \\
        b_{P,u_i}^c &= \quad \eta  \left(u_{i,E)}^{(n-1)} \left( \min(\dot{m}_e,0) - \gamma_e \right)\right) \\
                    &\quad + \eta \left( u_{i,P}^{(n-1)} \left( \max(0,\dot{m}_e) - \left(1 - \gamma_e\right) \right)\right)
      \end{align}
