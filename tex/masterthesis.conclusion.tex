\section{Conclusion and Outlook}

In the present thesis a fully-coupled solution algorithm for the Navier-Stokes equations with a finite-volume method on co-located, locally refined block structured grids was implemented. The main difference of this algorithm compared to the common segregated solution algorithms was the implicit pressure-velocity coupling. The pressure-velocity coupling is a characterizing aspect of solution algorithms for Navier-Stokes equations with the potential to significantly reduce the time for computation. Furthermore the solution algorithm was extended to solve for flows involving buoyant forces, by using an implicit Boussinesq approximation in the momentum balances to achieve velocity-to-temperature coupling and a Newton-Raphson linearization to realize implicit temperature-to-velocity/pressure coupling.

The CAFFA solver framework, that was extended in the thesis was verified using a grid convergence study and a three-dimensional manufactured solution for the velocities, the pressure and the temperature. Further studies on the segregated solution algorithm showed, that a special modification of the widely used Rhie-Chow momentum interpolation scheme is necessary to calculate results that are independent of the under relaxation factor and thus comparable with the results obtained with a fully-coupled solution algorithm. In the implementation of the algorithm the further use on high performance computers was considered, using the PETSc library for parallelisation of the involved data structures and solving the resulting linear systems with solvers and preconditioners provided from the same toolkit.

A comparison study was performed dealing with the effect of implicit pressure-velocity coupling in the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. Parallel performance measurements showed that for the implementation of the segregated and the coupled solution algorithm scalable program behaviour is possible for high numbers of involved unknowns. Performance studies on flows through complex geometries showed that the fully couple solution algorithm outperforms the segregated solution algorithm. 

The analyses regarding the different degrees of velocity-to-temperature and temperature-to-velocity/pressure coupling showed that the implicit temperature-to-velocity/pressure coupling is the key aspect of maintaining high efficiency regarding the computation time for flow problems involving temperature transport and strong coupling between the velocities, the pressure and the temperature.

The present thesis revealed different starting points to further examine the effects of coupled solution algorithms in the context of finite-volume flow solvers. In the present thesis only stationary problems were solved. Due to the moderate Rayleigh number for the heated cavity test case a stationary solution existed. By increasing the Rayleigh number the coupling between the velocities, the pressure and the temperature would get stronger, however the flow will get instationary. A further investigation could examine if coupled solution methods maintain the higher efficiency compared to segregated solution algorithms when applied to instationary flows.

In this thesis a temperature equation was successfully coupled to the modelling equations of a fluid. One straightforward application of the solver would deal with conjugate heat transfer problems. On the other side in practice there exist other similar transport equations that exhibit strong coupling to the velocities. Examples are the scalar transport of volume fractions, when multiphase flows are solved with Volume-of-Fluid methods or turbulent flows which depending on the turbulence model involve further scalar quantities that are strongly coupled to the velocities. Subsequent studies could examine if the corresponding transport equations if a coupling can be efficiently implemented.

All linear systems surging from the discretization process of the coupled system of partial differential equations were solved using black-box implementations of the available solvers in the PETSc library. As studies on finite-volume \cite{klaij13,darwish09,mairin14} and finite-element \cite{brown12,elman03,elman08,silvester01,turek02,mkcinnes14} discretizations show, a lot of information has not been used in the solution process of the linear system yet, which imposes a barrier on performance. In order to exploit the coupling and the structure of the linear systems two different approaches can be considered. On approach features so called \emph{physics-based} preconditioners as the SIMPLE preconditioner or other Schur-type preconditioners introduced in \cite{klaij13,elman08}. These kind of preconditioners accelerate the solution of the linear systems by taking into account the matrix structure as it is presented in figure \ref{fig:nointerlacemat}. At the moment further active research is needed to develop preconditioners for fully-coupled systems surging from finite-volume discretizations. Another approach that additionally maintains high scalability of the solution algorithm of the resulting linear systems have been presented in \cite{darwish09,marin14}. In these approaches algebraic multigrid methods are constructed, that, different to the GAMG preconditioner in PETSc, take into account the matrix structure.

As the studies in the present thesis showed, segregated solution algorithms can perform well compared to fully coupled solution algorithms for smaller numbers of unknowns. Furthermore due to the lower requirements on system memory, the problems that can be solved with segregated solution algorithms may for high numbers of unknowns not be computable with fully-coupled solution algorithms. Especially for flows involving temperature transport many other implementations of segregated solution algorithms exist, whose performance has not been compared with a coupled solution method. Examples can be found in \ref{liu84,oliveira01}.
