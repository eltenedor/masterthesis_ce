\section{Conclusion and Outlook}
Turbulence (turbulent viscosity has to be updated in each iteration), Multiphase (what about discontinuities), GPU-Accelerators, Load-Balancing, dynamic mesh refinement, Counjugate Heat Transfer with other requirements for the numerical grid, grid movement, list some papers here)
Identify the optimal regimes / conditions for maximizing performance. Each solver concept has its strengths and weaknesses.
Try other variants of Projection Methods like SIMPLEC, SIMPLER, PISO or PIMPLE (OpenFOAM)
